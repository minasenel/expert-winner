### Common Flutter Errors

1. If you get a "RenderFlex overflowed" error, check if a `Row` or `Column` contains unconstrained widgets. Fix by wrapping children in `Flexible`, `Expanded`, or by setting constraints.
2. If you get "Vertical viewport was given unbounded height", ensure `ListView` or similar scrollable widgets inside a `Column` have a bounded height (e.g., wrap with `Expanded` or `SizedBox`).
3. If you get "An InputDecorator...cannot have an unbounded width", constrain the width of widgets like `TextField` using `Expanded`, `SizedBox`, or by placing them in a parent with width constraints.
4. If you get a "setState called during build" error, do not call `setState` or `showDialog` directly inside the build method. Trigger dialogs or state changes in response to user actions or after the build completes (e.g., using `addPostFrameCallback`).
5. If you get "The ScrollController is attached to multiple scroll views", make sure each `ScrollController` is only attached to a single scrollable widget at a time.
6. If you get a "RenderBox was not laid out" error, check for missing or unbounded constraints in your widget tree. This is often caused by using widgets like `ListView` or `Column` without proper size constraints.
7. Use the Flutter Inspector and review widget constraints to debug layout issues. Refer to the official documentation on constraints if needed.
